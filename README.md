DangerClose is a modification for Minecraft that damages the player if they stand too close to certain blocks or entities.

Modders, Modpackdevelopers, and resource pack developers can extend burning damage or cutting damage by adding the tag `dangerclose:torch_burn_danger` or `dangerclose:cutting_danger` to blocks they would like.
